                <div>
                    <p>I am Jean, currently a student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau High School. I will introduce myself as we go through this website together :). Let’s start with who I am!</p>

                    <p>First, I am a hard-working person. I finish all tasks and assignments on time and with quality. Marks are important to me since they can reflect the efforts I put into my study. I always try my best in everything the teachers assign to me. I also joined the chemistry club for a year. As a result, in grade 10 science, I got a Science Certificate of Excellence – Highest Academic Achievement.</p>
                     
                    <p>Second, I love Math. I participated in the 2022 Youth Business Trend Competition. I received the Market Research Award for developing one of the most market-researched projects and the Theme Award for making one of the best projects relating to the theme against over 100 participants. I have written a few Math contests hosted by the University of Waterloo, such as Pascal, Cayley, and CIMC. I was in the first 2.4% in the 2023 Cayley Contest. I successfully got into the 2022 CIMC Honour Roll and was in the first 2.05%. I also wrote Euclid when I was in grade 10 to give it a try and was in the first 5.22%. I started self-learning calculus in grade 9 and wrote the 2023 AP Calculus BC Exam when I was in grade 10.</p>
                    
                    <p>Third, I like Computer Science. I self-studied HTML and CSS in grade 9 and made this website myself. I also self-learned Java and have built some small projects for fun!</p>
                    
                    <p>Lastly, I play basketball and the piano. I participate actively in activities such as the basketball games hosted after school when the gym is available. I play basketball outside almost every day if the weather is good. I play the piano during my spare time too. Although I stopped taking piano-level exams several years ago, I believe that emotions are more important than techniques. Therefore, I choose the songs I like and perform them using the piano!</p>
