                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>My name is Jean, currently a grade 11 student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau High School. I will introduce myself as we go through this website together :). Let’s start with who I am!</p>

                        <p>Firstly, I am a hard-working person. I finish all tasks and assignments on time and with quality. Grades are important to me because they can reflect the efforts I put into my study, and help me to identify and improve my weaknesses. 
                           I always try my best in everything I learn. I participated in the 2022 Youth Business Trend Competition. 
                           I received the <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Market%20Research%20Certificate.png?raw=true" target="_blank">Market Research Award</a> for developing one of the best market-researched projects and the <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Theme%20Certificate.png?raw=true" target="_blank">Theme Award</a> for making one of the most detailed projects relating to the topic against over 100 participants. 
                           I also joined the chemistry club to expand my experience. 
                           As a result, I got the Science Certificates of Excellence – Highest Academic Achievement in <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Science%20Certificate%20of%20Excellence_%20Jean%20Pan%20(Grade%2010%20Academic%20Science%20(SNC2D)).png?raw=true" target="_blank">grade 10 science</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Science%20Certificate%20of%20Excellence%20-%20Grade%2011%20University%20Preparation%20Chemistry%20SCH3U.png?raw=true" target="_blank">grade 11 university preparation chemistry</a>.
                        </p>
                     
                        <p>Secondly, I love Math. I have written a few Math contests hosted by the University of Waterloo, such as Cayley, CIMC, and Euclid. I was in the first 2.4% in the 2023 Cayley Contest. 
                           I successfully got into the <a href="https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests/2022/2022CxMCResults.pdf" target="_blank">2022 CIMC Honour Roll</a> and was in the first 2.05%. 
                           I also wrote Grade 12 Euclid when I was in grade 10 to challenge myself. As a result, I was the third place in our school, and I successfully got into the top 5.22% of all competitors. 
                           Because of my interest in this subject, I started self-learning calculus in grade 9. One year later, I wrote the 2023 AP Calculus BC Exam and got a score of 5.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Besides Math, Computer Science is also an interest for me. I self-studied <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Certificate%20-%20Responsive%20Web%20Design%20-%20Oct.22,%202022.png?raw=true" target="_blank">HTML and CSS</a> in grade 9 and created this website myself. 
                           I also self-learned <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Certificate%20-%20Java%20Programming%20-%20Aug.25,%202022.png?raw=true" target="_blank">Java</a> and have built some small projects for fun!
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>Lastly, I enjoy playing <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Basketball.jpg?raw=true" class="balllink" target="_blank">basketball</a><span class="ballword">basketball</span> and <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Piano.png?raw=true" target="_blank">the piano</a>. 
                           I participate actively in activities such as the basketball games hosted after school when the gym is available. I enjoy playing basketball because I believe this is a sport that requires teamwork to win, and I love to participate and contribute to the team to be the winner while exercising myself. 
                           I also enjoy  playing the piano during my spare time. I believe piano is a great tool for me to unwind my stress and pressure, as music allows me to relax and feel peaceful. Therefore, I love playing piano with my favorite’s songs. 
                        </p>

                        <p>In the end, I am definitely more diverse than I have described above. I look forward to building relationships with different people and sharing my experiences. I will also keep improving myself, to become a better Jean in the future. </p>
