            <section id="about">
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>I am Jean, currently a student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau High School. I will introduce myself as we go through this website together :). Let’s start with who I am!</p>

                    <p>First, I am a hard-working person. I finish all tasks and assignments on time and with quality. Marks are important to me since they can reflect the efforts I put into my study. 
                       I always try my best in everything the teachers assign to me. I also joined the chemistry club for a year. 
                       As a result, in grade 10 science, I got a <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Science%20Certificate%20of%20Excellence_%20Jean%20Pan%20(Grade%2010%20Academic%20Science%20(SNC2D)).png?raw=true" target="_blank">Science Certificate of Excellence – Highest Academic Achievement</a>.
                    </p>
                     
                    <p>Second, I love Math. I participated in the 2022 Youth Business Trend Competition. 
                       I received the <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Market%20Research%20Certificate.png?raw=true" target="_blank">Market Research Award</a> for developing one of the most market-researched projects and the <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Theme%20Certificate.png?raw=true" target="_blank">Theme Award</a> for making one of the best projects relating to the theme against over 100 participants. 
                       I have written a few Math contests hosted by the University of Waterloo, such as Pascal, Cayley, and CIMC. I was in the first 2.4% in the 2023 Cayley Contest. 
                       I successfully got into the <a href="https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests/2022/2022CxMCResults.pdf" target="_blank">2022 CIMC Honour Roll</a> and was in the first 2.05%. I also wrote Euclid when I was in grade 10 to give it a try and was in the first 5.22%. 
                       I started self-learning calculus in grade 9 and wrote the 2023 AP Calculus BC Exam when I was in grade 10.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Third, I like Computer Science. I self-studied <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Certificate%20-%20Responsive%20Web%20Design%20-%20Oct.22,%202022.png?raw=true" target="_blank">HTML and CSS</a> in grade 9 and made this website myself. 
                       I also self-learned <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Certificate%20-%20Java%20Programming%20-%20Aug.25,%202022.png?raw=true" target="_blank">Java</a> and have built some small projects for fun!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Lastly, I play basketball and <a href="https://github.com/Jeanpjy/Jean-Personal-Site/blob/main/Sources/Piano.png?raw=true" target="_blank">the piano</a>. 
                       I participate actively in activities such as the basketball games hosted after school when the gym is available. I play basketball outside almost every day if the weather is good. 
                       I play the piano during my spare time too. Although I stopped taking piano-level exams several years ago, I believe that emotions are more important than techniques. Therefore, I choose the songs I like and perform them using the piano!
